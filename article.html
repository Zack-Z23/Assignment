                <h2>What is Object-Oriente Programming? With some concepts.</h2>
                <p style="font-weight:bold; text-align: left;">By: Zacharias Zachariadis</p>
                
                <p style="text-align: left;">Febuary 11, 2022</p>


                <p style="text-align: left;">The main question that you might have is something along the lines of "What on earth is Object-Oriente Programming?".
                
                    Well you are in luck because the assignment that Mr. Specht is meant to serve that purpose. Object-Oriente Programming or OOP,
                
                    is meant to combine a group of data attributes with functions or methods into a unit called an "object." Typically, OOP languages
                
                    are class-based, which means that a class defines the data attributes and functions as a blueprint for creating objects, which are instances of the class. 
                

                        
                </p>
                <p>
                    A simple example would be a class representing a person. The person class would contain attributes to represent information such as the person’s age, name, height, etc. The class definition might also contain functions such as "sayMyName" which would simply print that person’s name to the screen.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>The 9 important basics of Object-Oriente Programming.</h3>
                
                <h4>Class</h4>
                
                <p>Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. </p>

                <h4>Object</h4>
                <p>In JavaScript, an object is a standalone entity, with properties and type. Compare it with a cup, for example. 
                    A cup is an object, with properties. 
                    A cup has a color, a design, weight, a material it is made of, etc. 
                    The same way, JavaScript objects can have properties, which define their characteristics.
                </p>
                <h4>Constructor</h4>
                <p>A constructor is a special function that creates and initializes an object instance of a class.
                    In JavaScript, a constructor gets called when an object is created using the new keyword. 
                    The purpose of a constructor is to create a new object and set values for any existing object properties</p>

                <h4>Accessor Methods(Setters, Getters)</h4>  
                <p>In JavaScript, accessor properties are methods that get or set the value of an object. 
                    For that, we use these two keywords: get - to define a getter method to get the property value.
                    set - to define a setter method to set the property value.</p>  

                <h4>Interface</h4>
                <p>Interfaces are capable of describing the wide range of shapes that JavaScript objects can take. 
                    In addition to describing an object with properties, interfaces are also capable of describing function types. 
                    To describe a function type with an interface, we give the interface a call signature.</p>    
                
                <h4>Abstraction</h4>
                <p>An abstraction is a way of hiding the implementation details and showing only the functionality to the users. 
                    In other words, it ignores the irrelevant details and shows only the required one.
                    </p> 
                    
                <h4>Encapsulation</h4>
                <p>
                    By definition Encapsulation in JavaScript is a process of binding the data with the functions which act upon the data.
                    ... Instead, if the callers want to achieve a defined result
                     it should use the public method or public entities inside the object to access the private variables of the object.</p>    

                <h4>Inherintance</h4>
                <p>Inheritance enables you to define a class that takes all the functionality from a parent class and allows you to add more. 
                    Using class inheritance, a class can inherit all the methods and properties of another class. 
                    Inheritance is a useful feature that allows code reusability.</p>
                 
                <h4>Polymorphism</h4>
                <p>
                    The polymorphism is a core concept of an object-oriented paradigm that provides a way to perform a single action in different forms. 
                    It provides an ability to call the same method on different JavaScript objects.
                     
                </p>   
                <h4>Design Patterns</h4> 
                <p>
                    As a good JavaScript developer, you strive to write clean, healthy, and maintainable code. ... 
                    You may not know it, but you've used a JavaScript design pattern. Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design.
